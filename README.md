# Learn ROS 2 by Building a Real Robot üöÄ

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing projects and exercises from the Udemy course [*"Learn ROS 2 by Building a Real Robot"*](https://www.udemy.com/course/ros-2-course/). This course adopts a *Learn by Doing* approach, blending theory, practical applications, and hands-on experiments with both simulated and real robots.

## üß† **Course Highlights**

- **Create a Real Robot**: Build and program a robot from scratch using ROS 2.
- **Digital Twin**: Simulate the robot using URDF, Gazebo, and RViz2.
- **Robot Control**: Implement actuators control with `ros2_control`.
- **Trajectory Planning**: Explore kinematics and trajectory planning with MoveIt 2.
- **Voice Interaction**: Use Alexa to actuate the robot.
- **Arduino Integration**: Interface with hardware using Arduino and serial communication.

The projects are implemented in both Python and C++, enabling flexibility and deep learning across multiple programming paradigms.

## üíª **Prerequisites**

- Basic knowledge of Python or C++
- Familiarity with Linux systems
- No prior experience with ROS or robotics theory is required
- A PC is sufficient for all simulations
